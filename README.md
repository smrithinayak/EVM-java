# Simple Voting System

This Java program simulates a basic voting system where a predefined list of voters can cast votes for a set of candidates. The program ensures that each voter can vote only once and displays the results after all votes are cast.

## Features

- **Candidate Management**: Allows the user to input a list of candidates.
- **Voter Verification**: Only registered voters can vote, and each voter can only vote once.
- **Vote Casting**: Voters select a candidate by entering the corresponding number.
- **Result Display**: After all votes are cast, the program displays the number of votes each candidate received.

## How It Works

1. **Voter List**: The program starts with a default list of voters (`AAA`, `BBB`, `CCC`, etc.).
2. **Candidate Input**: The user is prompted to enter the names of the candidates participating in the election.
3. **Voting Process**:
    - The program displays the list of voters.
    - Each voter is asked to enter their name.
    - If the voter is valid and has not already voted, they can cast their vote by selecting a candidate.
4. **Result Calculation**: Once all votes are cast, the program calculates and displays the vote count for each candidate.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/voting-system.git
   ```
2. **Compile and run the program**:
   ```bash
   javac Election.java
   java Election
   ```
3. **Follow the prompts** to input the number of candidates, their names, and to cast votes.

## Requirements
